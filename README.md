# SPED-Brazil---EFD-ICMS-IPI
This repository is part of the project SPED Brazil, specifically to generate the files related to EFD ICMS IPI. Code is python based and databse is MySQL. There is another repository for the data structure

This project was totally developed by me, alone and was used in production environment to generate SPED files to my own company, Overture Brewery. So some part of the code are related to brewery operations, but not necessarily is only to be used on brewery. It is aligned to all business.

I am sharing this code as my brewery close the operations and now I would like to help other people to keep going with SPED development.

If you find this code usefull, I would be happy to be invited by you to contribute professionally to develop a commercial solution based on this.
